Hi im @JOELARAGON10

========================================

Currently in my second year of studying Robotics, I am deeply passionate about constructing and programming robots for specific tasks. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have several hobbies that enrich my skills and knowledge, including a love for video games, piano playing, and a constant desire to learn new things.

My primary goal is to further immerse myself in the world of Robotics and the digital systems that comprise it. My dream is to travel the world, exploring and getting to know the latest technological advancements and the people who share my passion for this field. I aspire to actively engage with the global community of tech enthusiasts, contribute with my own creations, and learn from experts in various regions of the world.
